# The Aquascape Project - Mikee morales
### User Centric Front-end milestone project 1
TheAquascape is intended to provide __*free*__ information on starting a live planted, fresh-water aquarium and how to maintain them in the healthiest way possible.
With the main focus being an informational website, this site will also contain a forum portion where users can sign up, build a profile, ask questions, share tank photos, chat with one another, and have the opportunity to win giveaways to help maintain their tanks (for users who sign up only).

What started as a simple hobby of mine, became a personal project intended to help bring more awareness to this creative and natural hobby.

## UX
### User Stories
• As a user, I want to learn how to build and maintain an aquascape.

• As a user who has signed up to this website, I want to be able to connect with other members and be able to communicate anything I need with them.
### Strategy
My intentions are to provide free information on maintaining a fresh-water aquarium and awareness to this style of aquarium-keeping.
### Scope
I want to create a database of free information in one centralized website. Pro's and Con's of small and large tanks, types of fish you can house, types of plants you can grow, how tank cycling works, water care and how to introduce beneficial bacteria safely and effectively, etc.
### Structure
The most important page of this website will be the first page in the navigation bar labeled "Beginner's Guide." This is a page that leads to the __six__ important functions of an aquascape:
* Aquarium Size
* Water Care
* Cycling
* Algae Control
* Flora
* Fauna

The second most essential part of this website is the "Forums" page. This leads to a signup/signin portion of the website, where users can create profiles to access private topics and conversations.
