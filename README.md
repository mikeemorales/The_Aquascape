# The Aquascape Project - Mikee morales
### User Centric Front-end milestone project 1
TheAquascape is intended to provide __*FREE*__ information on starting a live planted, fresh-water aquarium and how to maintain them in the healthiest way possible.
With the main focus being an informational website, this site will also contain a forum portion where users can sign up, build a profile, ask questions, share tank photos, chat with one another, and have the opportunity to win giveaways to help maintain their tanks (for users who sign up only).

What started as a simple hobby of mine, became a personal project intended to help bring more awareness to this creative and natural hobby.

## UX
### User Stories
* As a user, I want to learn how to build and maintain an aquascape.

* As a user who has signed up to this website, I want to be able to connect with other members and be able to communicate anything I need with them.
### Strategy
My intentions are to provide free information on maintaining a fresh-water aquarium and awareness to this style of aquarium-keeping.
### Scope
I want to create a database of free information in one centralized website. Pro's and Con's of small and large tanks, types of fish you can house, types of plants you can grow, how tank cycling works, water care and how to introduce beneficial bacteria safely and effectively, etc.
### Structure
The most important page of this website will be the first page in the navigation bar labeled "Beginner's Guide." This is a page that leads to the __six__ important functions of an aquascape:
* Aquarium Size
* Water Care
* Cycling
* Algae Control
* Flora
* Fauna

The second most essential part of this website is the "Forums" page. This leads to a signup/signin portion of the website, where users can create profiles to access private topics and conversations.

### Surface
 key information:
 #### navbar will be in dark grey, with white text for each page. The Sign in button will reside within the nav as well, with a blue-rounded background button.

 #### each page will have a header image containing a tagline and small description of what the page is about. The index page will contain a sign up modal button.

 #### the footer will contain three columns. Another navigation section to prevent having to scroll back up top to the original nav, a newsletter signup incase the user does not want to create an official account, but would like marketing updates, and a mission statement as the last column.

 #### Typography
 fonts used across the board are: QUICKSAND - with a back up of sans serif.
 #### colors
 the primary colors for this website will be grey, white, and blue. secondary colors will be utilized to add small detail.

 ## Technology
 * html
 * css
 * bootstrap (related js included)
 
 ## Features
 This site mainly features bootstrap functions (modal, js, grid system, etc.) with customized edits in the css files.

 ## Testing
 Each page has been tested via web browser and browser source viewer.

 Using the source code in the browser, various screen size testing has been implemented to ensure website functions properly across multiple devices.

 Contact information, login, sign up, etc. required sections have been tested to ensure that an alert may pop up when a section is left blank. If you try to submit a form without a proper email, an alert will pop up stating that said proper email is required.

 The footer contains a link for the instagram account of TheAquascape. "target=_blank" has been used to launch a new window to access the instagram account and has been found succcessful.

 #### THINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED 
* Beginner's guide sub pages: Only the "Aquarium Size" subpage button has a working subpage. The rest only have descriptions of what the subpages contain. Content will be added later
* SignUp/SignIn Submit's do not have an active requirement alert when trying to submit.
* Log In's and Sign Up's are currently available for aesthetic purpose. Database and internal framework has not been implemented at this point.
* Forum page is currently available for aesthetic purpose. Database and internal framework has not been implemented at this point.
* Forms are currently available for aesthetic purpose. Databse and internal framework for submitting has not been implemented at this point.

#### SOCIAL MEDIA
* The only social media linked to this website is an instagram page (which is fully functional and running). This link is located in the footer. No other social icons (fb,linkedin,email) are needed for this website.

 ## Deployment

 This site is deployed through Github Pages directly through the master branch. As I work on this project at work and from home, I have installed the github desktop application to push commits and to clone repositories whenever I'm at a different location. A link has been provided at the top of this document to view the website.

 ### Acknowledgements
 * Inspiration for this passion project has been through personal experiences of this hobby.
